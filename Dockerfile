# STEP-1 BUILD
# Defining node image and giving alias as node-helper
# It's better to define version otherwise me might face issue in future build

FROM node:14-alpine3.15 as node-helper

#Accepting build-arg to create environment specific build
#it is useful when we have multiple environment (e.g: dev, tst, staging, prod)
#default value is development
ARG build_env=development

#Creating virtual directory inside docker image
WORKDIR /app

#Copying file from local machine to virtual docker image directory
COPY . .

#installing deps for project
RUN npm install

#creating angular build
RUN ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --configuration=$build_env

#STEP-2 RUN
#Defining nginx img 
FROM nginx:1.20 as ngx

#copying compiled code from dist to nginx folder for serving
